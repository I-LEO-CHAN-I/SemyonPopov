- Hello there! I am Leo, a guy that just started to learning programming.
- Real name - Simon (Well, Simon is not so correct. On my native language my name may sounds funny for you, so, let's stop on "Simon")
- I am a little stupid, so teach me some things, if you want to.
- And, as you can see, I bad know English :)
- Зато Русский знаю неплохо. Не буду против, если будете давать советы именно на нём.
